*Open Sourced FPS game inspired by Battlefield 2*

This project superseds bf2redux.

## About
"TWO" is a project intended to replicate much of the gameplay from Battlefield 2 in a modern game engine. I am aiming for a playable build in April 2021. This project will be developed in Unreal Engine 4, later moving to Unreal Engine 5.





## Directory Structure
* Blueprints/
  - This is where blueprints will be.
* Megascans/
  - Folder for Quixel Megascans. note - no megascans will be pushed to the repo. only a manifest file (todo:)
* ThirdParty/
  - Any UE4 marketplace assets will be here. Will not be pushed to the repo. However if any assets are used the manifest file will need to be updated.

## Licensing 
* The project itself is placed under the MIT license. You may use it however you like. 

* BUT any marketplace assets (including UE4 free assets -eg : animStarterPack) are not available on this repository as they belong to Epic Games (and other authors too!). 

* However if you want to help with development - join the official [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/x98DEFy) (if you have UE4 installed and a Quixel license, I can send you the UE4 animation assets and megascans).
